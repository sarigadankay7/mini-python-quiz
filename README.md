🎯 **Mini Python Quiz** is a hilarious and beginner-friendly project that dares you to face… three questions.  
🧠 Built entirely using `if` statements (yeah, no fancy loops here).

⚙️ Great for practice, fun, or making your friends feel bad at trivia.  
🐍 Written in Python – obviously, because we're classy like that.
